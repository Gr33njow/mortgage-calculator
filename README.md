# Mortgage Repayment Calculator - Front End Mentor Challenge

![Design preview for the Mortgage Repayment Calculator challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Overview

Welcome to my solution for the **Mortgage Repayment Calculator** challenge from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)! This project is a front-end coding challenge designed to help developers improve their skills by building realistic projects. I built this mortgage repayment calculator using **HTML**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **JavaScript**, aiming to match the provided design as closely as possible while ensuring functionality and accessibility.

### The Challenge

The goal of this challenge was to create a mortgage repayment calculator that allows users to input mortgage details and calculate their monthly and total repayments. The project required a responsive design, form validation, keyboard navigation, and interactive states for all elements.

#### User Requirements
Users should be able to:
- Input mortgage information (amount, term, interest rate, and type) and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form.
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete or invalid.
- Complete the form using only their keyboard.
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

- **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Fully accessible via keyboard, with proper focus states for interactive elements.
- **Interactive States**: Hover and focus states for buttons and form inputs, enhancing user experience.
- **Clear All Functionality**: A "Clear All" button to reset the form and results to their initial state.
